# SpoofCyton
##Cyton spoofer for moment (spoofs moment client receiving data from cyton)

 Added Delphi project. Moment must first be opened and a server must be started. Then you connect to the server with the CytonSpoofer. After that, click select folder and navigate to the folder containing the data saved by moment_client. Currently this data is only obtained when the debug_rg is at index 0, i.e. it writes everything to the memo box and flushes it every 5000 lines. Changes need to be made in either moment_client or moment itself to allow this data to be saved while also sending the data to moment in order to have more effective data collection. The included dataset is of Benett collecting data while playing flanker. I specifically instructed him to not een open up moment, just start the moment_client and play the task so that we could get this dataset. After the folder is selected, press start. The first memobox is populated with data and those data are sent to moment. The other memobox is read in from another thread. Once memo1 is done writing all of its lines, memo2 will be the one who has its lines sent to the server. Memo1 is then populated by the child thread. Currently there is a gap during this process which indicates the threads are not getting along so swimingly. Perhaps there is some overhead in creating and killing the thread which could be avoided by pausing and resuming.
